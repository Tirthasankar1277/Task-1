## 🎯 ObjectiveMore actions
Learn to discover open ports on devices in your local network to understand network exposure and basic cybersecurity risks.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- [`Nmap`](https://nmap.org/) – Network scanning and reconnaissance
- [`Wireshark`](https://www.wireshark.org/) *(optional)* – Packet analysis
- Kali Linux Terminal

---

## 📘 Concepts Learned

* Network reconnaissance using IP ranges (`/24`)
* TCP SYN scanning and open port enumeration
* Service identification and basic risk analysis
* Optional packet inspection with Wireshark

## 🧠 Conclusion

This task helped reinforce the foundational skills of port scanning, identifying active hosts, and recognizing potential security exposures in a network environment. It also builds a critical understanding of how threat actors perform reconnaissance — and how defenders can detect and mitigate risks.
